My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal projects portfolio! This repository showcases my programming projects, organized by complexity into Simple, Intermediate, and Advanced categories. Each project resides in its own folder with a dedicated README for details. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!

Project Categories

Simple Projects

These projects demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and are great for beginners or quick implementations.

Age Calculator: A Python script that calculates age in years, months, days, hours, and seconds based on birth date. Includes CLI input, logging, and error handling. [Read more](Simple-Projects/age-calculator/README.md)

Translator App: A Python script for translating text to multiple languages using Google Translate API. Features CLI, history tracking, and supported language listing. [Read more](Simple-Projects/translator-app/README.md)

Voice Command App: A Python script that uses speech recognition to process voice commands (e.g., open Google Chrome) in Persian or other languages. Includes CLI and cross-platform support. [Read more](Simple-Projects/voice-command-app/README.md)

Speech-to-Text-to-Speech Translator: A Python script that converts spoken input to text, translates it, and speaks the translation. Features CLI, history tracking, and TTS. [Read more](Simple-Projects/speech-translator/README.md)
