## üéÆ How to Run

### 1. Set Up the Bot
1. Obtain a Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Set up a Replicate API token at [Replicate](https://replicate.com).
3. Store tokens securely (e.g., as environment variables or in a config file).

### 2. Run the Script
Launch the Telegram bot with default settings:
```bash
python text_to_video_generator.py --bot_token YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN --replicate_token YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN
```

### 3. Interact with the Bot
- Send `/start` to the bot on Telegram to begin.
- Input a text prompt (e.g., "A vibrant Persian festival under starry skies") to generate a video.
- Receive real-time updates and the final video delivered directly in Telegram.

### 4. Customize Your Workflow
- `--bot_token`: Your Telegram bot token.
- `--replicate_token`: Your Replicate API token.
- `--fps`: Frames per second for the video (e.g., `30`).
- `--steps`: Number of generation steps (e.g., `50`).

## üìà Example Interaction
- **User Input**:
  ```
  /start
  A serene mountain landscape with a flowing river
  ```
- **Bot Response**:
  ```
  Received your prompt! Translating...
  Processing video with VideoCrafter...
  Video generated! Delivering now...
  [Video delivered: A flowing river through a serene mountain landscape]
  ```
- **Logs**:
  ```
  INFO: Received prompt: A serene mountain landscape with a flowing river
  INFO: Translated to English: A serene mountain landscape with a flowing river
  INFO: Video generated and sent successfully
  ```
