## üéÆ How to Run

### 1. Train the Model
Build and train a CNN with customizable parameters:
```bash
python handwritten_digit_recognizer.py --mode train --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### 2. Predict on Custom Images
Recognize digits from a user-provided 28x28 grayscale image:
```bash
python handwritten_digit_recognizer.py --mode predict --image_path path/to/image.png
```

### 3. Customize Your Workflow
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (e.g., `50`).
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training (e.g., `32`).
- `--model_path`: Save/load the trained model (e.g., `models/digit_recognizer_model.h5`).
