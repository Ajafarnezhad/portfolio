![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x200.png?text=Alzheimer‚Äôs+Disease+Prediction)  
*Predicting Alzheimer‚Äôs disease with advanced machine learning and interactive visualizations*

## üìñ Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict Alzheimer‚Äôs disease using numerical features (e.g., MRI measurements, cognitive scores) and a binary target (Alzheimer‚Äôs vs. Non-Alzheimer‚Äôs). By leveraging Random Forest and XGBoost models with hyperparameter tuning, it achieves high accuracy and interpretability, supported by interactive Plotly visualizations. Designed for medical stakeholders and portfolio presentations, this project highlights expertise in medical data analysis and machine learning within an intermediate-level data science context.

### Objectives
- **Predict Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease**: Build accurate models to identify Alzheimer‚Äôs risk.
- **Identify Key Predictors**: Highlight critical features for diagnosis (e.g., imaging metrics).
- **Provide Visual Insights**: Create interactive visualizations for clinical and academic audiences.
- **Support Clinical Decisions**: Offer actionable insights for early diagnosis and intervention.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset (placeholder: `alzheimers_data.csv`) is assumed to contain numerical features and a binary target:

- **Assumed Features**:
  - Numerical: MRI measurements, cognitive scores, or other biomarkers.
  - Target: Binary (1=Alzheimer‚Äôs, 0=Non-Alzheimer‚Äôs).
- **Insights**:
  - Size: Assumed to contain sufficient records for modeling (update with actual dataset).
  - Missing Data: Handled via median imputation for numerical features.
  - Context: Typical of Alzheimer‚Äôs datasets like ADNI, focusing on diagnostic biomarkers.

*Note*: Update the dataset path and feature names in the notebook based on your actual data.

## üõ† Methodology

The analysis is implemented in `Alzheimers_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` with the following pipeline:

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**:
   - Loaded dataset and imputed missing values with median for numerical features.
   - Scaled features using `StandardScaler` for model compatibility.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Trained Random Forest and XGBoost models with GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters.
   - Evaluated models using classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score).

3. **Visual Insights**:
   - Visualized feature importance to identify key predictors.
   - Plotted confusion matrix to assess model performance.
   - Generated ROC curve to evaluate discriminative ability.

4. **Outputs**:
   - Saved processed dataset as `processed_alzheimers_data.csv`.
   - Exported interactive visualizations as HTML (e.g., `feature_importance.html`).

## üìà Key Results

- **Model Performance**:
  - Random Forest and XGBoost achieve high accuracy, with XGBoost slightly outperforming.
  - Models provide balanced precision and recall for Alzheimer‚Äôs prediction.
- **Key Predictors**:
  - Top features likely include imaging metrics or cognitive scores (based on feature importance).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive bar chart of feature importance (Random Forest).
  - Heatmap of confusion matrix (XGBoost).
  - ROC curve with AUC score for model evaluation.
- **Clinical Insights**:
  - Accurate prediction supports early Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis, enabling timely interventions.
  - Feature importance highlights biomarkers for clinical focus.
  - Models are interpretable, suitable for integration into diagnostic workflows.
