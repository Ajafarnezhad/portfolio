![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x200.png?text=Oral+Cancer+Prediction)  
*Advancing early diagnosis with deep learning and interpretable visualizations*

## üìñ Project Overview

This project develops a cutting-edge deep learning pipeline to predict oral cancer from medical images, using a dataset of Malignant and Benign cases. By integrating ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and XGBoost models with SHAP explanations, it achieves high accuracy and interpretability. Interactive Plotly visualizations highlight model performance and class distribution, making it ideal for clinical stakeholders and a standout addition to an intermediate-level data science portfolio.

### Objectives
- **Predict Oral Cancer**: Build accurate models for early diagnosis from medical images.
- **Identify Key Features**: Highlight critical image-based features driving predictions.
- **Provide Interpretable Visuals**: Create interactive visualizations for clinical and academic audiences.
- **Support Clinical Decision-Making**: Offer insights for early detection and intervention.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset (assumed extracted from `OralCancer.rar`) contains medical images organized into two classes:

- **Classes**:
  - `Malignant`: Images indicating oral cancer.
  - `Benign`: Images indicating non-cancerous conditions.
- **Insights**:
  - Format: Assumed JPG/PNG images in `OralCancer/Malignant` and `OralCancer/Benign` directories.
  - Size: Assumed sufficient images for training (update with actual dataset details).
  - Preprocessing: Applied data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip) and rescaling for robustness.

*Note*: Ensure `OralCancer.rar` is extracted to a local `OralCancer` directory with Malignant/Benign subfolders.

## üõ† Methodology

The analysis is implemented in `Oral_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb` with the following pipeline:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded images from `OralCancer` directory using `ImageDataGenerator`.
   - Applied augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip) for training robustness.
   - Rescaled images to 224x224 for CNN compatibility.

2. **Feature Extraction and Model Training**:
   - Trained ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 CNNs with transfer learning (ImageNet weights).
   - Extracted features from ResNet50 for XGBoost training.
   - Used early stopping and learning rate reduction for optimal convergence.

3. **Clinical Visualizations**:
   - Visualized class distribution to assess dataset balance.
   - Plotted confusion matrix and ROC curve for performance evaluation.
   - Used SHAP explanations for XGBoost feature impact.

4. **Outputs**:
   - Saved models as `resnet_oral_cancer.keras`, `effnet_oral_cancer.keras`, and `xgb_oral_cancer.json`.
   - Exported visualizations as HTML (e.g., `confusion_matrix.html`) and SHAP plot as PNG.

## üìà Key Results

- **Model Performance**:
  - EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 achieve high accuracy, with XGBoost enhancing feature-based predictions.
  - Balanced sensitivity and specificity support reliable diagnosis.
- **Key Features**:
  - Image-based features (e.g., texture, color patterns) drive predictions, based on SHAP analysis.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive bar chart of class distribution.
  - Heatmap of confusion matrix and ROC curve (EfficientNetB0).
  - SHAP summary plot for feature impact (XGBoost).
- **Clinical Insights**:
  - Accurate prediction enables early oral cancer detection, supporting timely interventions.
  - Interpretable models aid integration into clinical imaging systems.
  - Non-invasive image analysis offers scalable diagnostic potential.
