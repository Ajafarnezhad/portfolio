# 💳 Credit Score Classification: Empowering Financial Decisions with Python

## 🌟 Project Vision
Step into the world of financial analytics with the **Credit Score Classification** project, a sophisticated Python-based application that leverages machine learning to classify customers into credit score categories (Good, Standard, Poor). By analyzing key financial metrics such as income, debt, and payment behavior, this project empowers banks and financial institutions to assess creditworthiness with precision. With stunning visualizations, a sleek command-line interface (CLI), and robust error handling, it’s a dazzling showcase of data science expertise, crafted to elevate your portfolio to global standards.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Seamless Data Integration** 📊: Loads and validates credit history data with robust checks for integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Visualizes credit score distributions, payment behavior, and financial metrics through interactive Plotly charts.
- **Machine Learning Model** 🧠: Employs a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores based on key financial features.
- **Interactive Predictions** 💸: Allows users to input financial data for real-time credit score predictions.
- **Elegant CLI Interface** 🖥️: Offers intuitive commands for data analysis, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with meticulous checks and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Scalable Design** ⚙️: Supports extensible classification models and large datasets for diverse financial applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power your analysis:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `plotly`

Install them with a single command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```

### Dataset Spotlight
The **Credit Score Dataset** is your key to financial insights:
- **Source**: Available at [Kaggle Credit Score Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification).
- **Content**: Contains customer financial data with columns for `Annual_Income`, `Monthly_Inhand_Salary`, `Num_Bank_Accounts`, `Num_Credit_Card`, `Interest_Rate`, `Num_of_Loan`, `Delay_from_due_date`, `Num_of_Delayed_Payment`, `Credit_Mix`, `Outstanding_Debt`, `Credit_History_Age`, `Monthly_Balance`, and `Credit_Score`.
- **Size**: 100,000 records, ideal for credit score classification.
- **Setup**: Download and place `train.csv` in the project directory or specify its path via the CLI.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Analyze Credit Data
Perform EDA to explore credit score distributions and financial metrics:
```bash
python credit_score_classification.py --mode analyze --data_path train.csv
```

### 2. Predict Credit Scores
Generate credit score predictions for user-provided financial data:
```bash
python credit_score_classification.py --mode predict --data_path train.csv
```

### 3. Visualize Insights
Generate interactive visualizations for credit trends:
```bash
python credit_score_classification.py --mode visualize --data_path train.csv
```

### CLI Options
- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA), `predict` (credit score prediction), or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset (default: `train.csv`).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).

## 📊 Sample Output

### Analysis Output
```
🌟 Loaded credit score dataset (100,000 records)
🔍 Average Annual Income: $50,523.45 (std: $37,543.21)
✅ Key Insight: High monthly balances (> $250) correlate with Good credit scores
```

### Prediction Output
```
📈 Predicted Credit Score for input:
- Annual Income: $19,114.12
- Monthly Salary: $1,824.84
- Credit Mix: Good
- ...
Result: Good
```

### Visualizations
Find interactive plots in the `plots/` folder:
- `credit_score_distribution.png`: Pie chart of credit score categories.
- `credit_scores_by_balance.png`: Box plot of credit scores by monthly balance.
- `credit_scores_by_income.png`: Box plot of credit scores by annual income.

## 🌈 Future Enhancements
