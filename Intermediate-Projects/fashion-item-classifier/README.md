### Dataset Overview
The **Fashion MNIST** dataset, automatically downloaded via TensorFlow, is your gateway to fashion classification:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels).
- **Test Set**: 10,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels).
- **Classes**: 10 categories, including T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Train the Model
Build a cutting-edge CNN with customizable training parameters:
```bash
python fashion_item_classifier.py --mode train --epochs 30 --batch_size 128
```

### 2. Predict with Style
Classify a custom 28x28 grayscale image:
```bash
python fashion_item_classifier.py --mode predict --image_path path/to/image.png
```

### CLI Options
- `--model_path`: Specify where to save/load the model (default: `fashion_classifier_model.h5`).
- `--epochs`: Set the number of training epochs (default: 30).
- `--batch_size`: Define the batch size for training (default: 128).
