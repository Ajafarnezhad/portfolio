# Type 2 Diabetes Prediction

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x200.png?text=Type+2+Diabetes+Prediction)  
*Advancing early diagnosis with machine learning and interpretable visualizations*

## üìñ Project Overview

This project develops a cutting-edge machine learning pipeline to predict Type 2 diabetes using the UCI Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models with SHAP explanations, it achieves high accuracy and interpretability. Interactive Plotly visualizations highlight key predictors and model performance, making it ideal for clinical stakeholders and a standout addition to an intermediate-level data science portfolio.

### Objectives
- **Predict Type 2 Diabetes**: Build accurate models for early diagnosis.
- **Identify Key Biomarkers**: Highlight critical features (e.g., Glucose, BMI) driving predictions.
- **Provide Interpretable Visuals**: Create interactive visualizations for clinical and academic audiences.
- **Support Clinical Decision-Making**: Offer insights for preventive care and interventions.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (`pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv`) and contains 768 records with 8 features:

- **Key Features**:
  - `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies.
  - `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration.
  - `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure.
  - `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness.
  - `Insulin`: 2-hour serum insulin.
  - `BMI`: Body mass index.
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function.
  - `Age`: Age of the patient.
  - `Outcome`: Binary (1=Diabetes, 0=No Diabetes).
- **Insights**:
  - Size: 768 rows, 9 columns.
  - Missing Data: Zeros in `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI` treated as missing and imputed with median.
  - Context: Pima Indian population, high-risk for Type 2 diabetes.

## üõ† Methodology

The analysis is implemented in `Type2_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` with the following pipeline:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation**:
   - Downloaded dataset from UCI repository.
   - Handled missing values (zeros) with median imputation.
   - Applied SMOTE for class imbalance and scaled features with `StandardScaler`.

2. **Model Optimization and Training**:
   - Trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluated models using classification reports and confusion matrices.

3. **Diagnostic Visualizations**:
   - Visualized feature importance to identify key biomarkers.
   - Used SHAP explanations to interpret feature impact.
   - Plotted confusion matrix and ROC curves for performance assessment.

4. **Outputs**:
   - Saved processed dataset as `processed_diabetes_data.csv`.
   - Exported interactive visualizations as HTML (e.g., `feature_importance.html`) and SHAP plot as PNG.

## üìà Key Results

- **Model Performance**:
  - LightGBM and XGBoost outperform Random Forest, with high sensitivity for diabetes detection.
  - Balanced accuracy supports reliable prediction.
- **Key Biomarkers**:
  - Glucose, BMI, and Diabetes Pedigree Function are top predictors, based on feature importance and SHAP analysis.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive bar chart of feature importance (LightGBM).
  - SHAP summary plot showing feature impact.
  - Heatmap of confusion matrix and combined ROC curves for all models.
- **Clinical Insights**:
  - Accurate prediction enables early Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, supporting preventive care.
  - Interpretable models and visualizations aid clinical adoption.
  - Biomarkers like Glucose and BMI offer actionable screening targets.
