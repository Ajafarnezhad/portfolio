## üéÆ How to Run

### 1. Train the Model
Build and train a CNN with customizable parameters:
```bash
python cifar10_classifier.py --mode train --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### 2. Predict on Custom Images
Classify a user-provided 32x32 color image:
```bash
python cifar10_classifier.py --mode predict --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

### 3. Customize Your Workflow
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (e.g., `50`).
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training (e.g., `32`).
- `--model_path`: Save/load the trained model (e.g., `models/cifar10_model.h5`).
