With stunning visualizations, a sleek command-line interface (CLI), and robust error handling, it’s a dazzling showcase of data science expertise, crafted to elevate your portfolio to global standards.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Seamless Data Integration** 📊: Loads and validates comprehensive supply chain data with robust checks for integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Visualizes revenue, stock levels, order quantities, shipping costs, and defect rates through interactive Plotly charts.
- **Cost and Efficiency Insights** 💸: Analyzes shipping costs by carrier and transportation mode to optimize logistics.
- **Defect Rate Analysis** 🛠️: Identifies defect patterns across product types and transportation modes for quality improvement.
- **Elegant CLI Interface** 🖥️: Offers intuitive commands for data analysis and visualization, with customizable options.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with meticulous checks and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Scalable Design** ⚙️: Supports extensible analysis for large datasets and diverse supply chain applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power your analysis:
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`
  - `numpy`

Install them with a single command:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly numpy
```

### Dataset Spotlight
The **Supply Chain Dataset** is your key to operational insights:
- **Source**: Available at [Kaggle Supply Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis).
- **Content**: Contains data on product types, SKUs, prices, availability, sales, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping details, and defect rates.
- **Size**: 100 records, ideal for supply chain analysis.
- **Setup**: Download and place `supply_chain_data.csv` in the project directory or specify its path via the CLI.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Analyze Supply Chain Data
Perform EDA to explore revenue, inventory, and logistics metrics:
```bash
python supply_chain_analysis.py --mode analyze --data_path supply_chain_data.csv
```

### 2. Visualize Insights
Generate interactive visualizations for supply chain trends:
```bash
python supply_chain_analysis.py --mode visualize --data_path supply_chain_data.csv
```

### CLI Options
- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA and metrics) or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset (default: `supply_chain_data.csv`).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).

## 📊 Sample Output

### Analysis Output
```
🌟 Loaded supply chain dataset (100 records)
🔍 Average Revenue per SKU: $5,776.05 (std: $2,732.84)
✅ Key Insight: Haircare products have the highest defect rate (2.45%)
```

### Visualizations
Find interactive plots in the `plots/` folder:
- `revenue_by_sku.png`: Line chart of revenue generated by SKU.
- `stock_levels_by_sku.png`: Line chart of stock levels by SKU.
- `order_quantity_by_sku.png`: Bar chart of order quantities by SKU.
- `shipping_costs_by_carrier.png`: Bar chart of shipping costs by carrier.
- `cost_by_transportation_mode.png`: Donut plot of cost distribution by transportation mode.
- `defect_rates_by_product.png`: Bar chart of defect rates by product type.
- `defect_rates_by_transportation.png`: Donut plot of defect rates by transportation mode.

## 🌈 Future Enhancements
- **Predictive Analytics** 🚀: Integrate machine learning to forecast inventory needs and defect rates.
- **Optimization Models** 📉: Implement linear programming for cost-efficient transportation and inventory management.
- **Web App Deployment** 🌐: Transform into an interactive dashboard with Streamlit for real-time insights.
- **Real-Time Data** ⚡: Enable live data feeds for dynamic supply chain monitoring.
- **Unit Testing** 🛠️: Add `pytest` for robust validation of data processing and analytics.
