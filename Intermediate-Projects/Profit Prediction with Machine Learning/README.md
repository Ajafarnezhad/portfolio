# 💰 Profit Prediction: Optimizing Business Success with Advanced Machine Learning

## 🌟 Project Vision
Step into the future of business analytics with the **Profit Prediction** project, an advanced Python-based application that forecasts startup profits using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. By leveraging a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, this system analyzes key metrics such as R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and state of operation to deliver precise profit forecasts. With interactive Plotly visualizations, a robust CLI interface, and automated dataset downloading, this project is a flagship addition to any data science portfolio, showcasing expertise in predictive modeling and business intelligence.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Automated Data Acquisition** 📥: Seamlessly downloads the 50 Startups dataset from Kaggle using the `kaggle` API.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering** 📚: Incorporates interaction terms (e.g., R&D × Marketing Spend) for enhanced model performance.
- **Random Forest Regressor** 🧠: Utilizes an ensemble model with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV for superior accuracy.
- **Interactive Predictions** 💸: Enables real-time profit forecasts based on user-provided business metrics.
- **Sophisticated CLI Interface** 🖥️: Provides intuitive commands for data analysis, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with comprehensive validation and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Scalable & Modular Design** ⚙️: Supports extensible models, datasets, and dependency injection for diverse business applications.
- **Interactive Visualizations** 📊: Generates dynamic correlation heatmaps and feature importance plots using Plotly.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Kaggle API**: Requires a Kaggle account and API token (`kaggle.json`) in `~/.kaggle/`.
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power your analysis:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `plotly`
  - `kaggle`

Install them with a single command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly kaggle
```

### Dataset Spotlight
The **50 Startups Dataset** is the cornerstone of this prediction system:
- **Source**: Kaggle ([50 Startups](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/startup-success-prediction)).
- **Content**: Contains 50 records with columns for `R&D Spend`, `Administration`, `Marketing Spend`, `State`, and `Profit`.
- **Setup**: Automatically downloaded via the `kaggle` API, or provide a local CSV file with the same structure.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Setup Kaggle API
1. Create a Kaggle account and download your API token (`kaggle.json`) from Kaggle’s user settings.
2. Place `kaggle.json` in `~/.kaggle/` and run:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

### 2. Analyze Startup Data
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover feature distributions and correlations:
```bash
python profit_prediction.py --mode analyze
```

### 3. Train and Evaluate Model
Train the Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning and evaluate its performance:
```bash
python profit_prediction.py --mode train
```

### 4. Predict Profit
Generate profit predictions for a startup:
```bash
python profit_prediction.py --mode predict --rd_spend 100000 --administration 120000 --marketing_spend 200000 --state California
```

### 5. Visualize Insights
Generate interactive visualizations for profit trends and feature importance:
```bash
python profit_prediction.py --mode visualize
```

### CLI Options
- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA), `train` (train and evaluate model), `predict` (profit prediction), or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to a local dataset (optional; downloads Kaggle dataset if not provided).
- `--rd_spend`, `--administration`, `--marketing_spend`, `--state`: Business metrics for prediction (required for `predict` mode).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).
