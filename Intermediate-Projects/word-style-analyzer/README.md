## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Libraries**:
  - `python-docx`
  - `nltk`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly`
  - `pandas`
  - `sqlalchemy`
- **NLTK Data**: Automatically downloaded on first run (requires internet connection).

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install python-docx nltk matplotlib seaborn plotly pandas sqlalchemy
```

---

## üìÇ Input & Output
- **Input**: Any valid `.docx` file (e.g., `process_design_notes.docx`).
- **Output**:
  - Processed artifacts (JSON, CSV, HTML, SQLite) saved in the `output/` directory.
  - Interactive visualizations saved in the `plots/` directory.
  - Logs saved in the working directory.

---

## üéÆ How to Run

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- Install dependencies as listed above.
- Ensure NLTK data is downloaded (handled automatically on first run with an internet connection).

### 2. Prepare Input
- Place your `.docx` file (e.g., `process_design_notes.docx`) in the working directory.

### 3. Execute the Script
Run the analyzer with customizable options:
```bash
# For Linux/Mac
python3 style_analyzer.py process_design_notes.docx --output_format json --visualize
# For Windows
python style_analyzer.py process_design_notes.docx --output_format csv --verbose
```

### 4. Optional Flags
- `--output_dir`: Specify a custom output directory (default: `output`).
- `--output_format`: Choose output format (`json`, `csv`, `html`, `sqlite`, `append`).
- `--visualize`: Generate interactive Plotly visualizations.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging for debugging.

## üìà Example Output
- **Logs**:
  ```
  INFO: Processing document: process_design_notes.docx
  INFO: Extracted 120 bold words, 85 italic words, 30 underlined words
  INFO: Sentiment analysis - Compound score: 0.75 (Positive)
  INFO: Artifacts saved to output/style_analysis.json
  INFO: Visualizations saved to plots/style_bar_plot.html
  ```
- **Visualizations** (in `plots/`):
  - `style_bar_plot.html`: Bar plot of styled text frequencies.
  - `style_box_plot.html`: Box plot of styled text statistics.
- **Output Files** (in `output/`):
  - `style_analysis.json`: Structured JSON with styled text and sentiment data.
  - `style_analysis.csv`: Tabular data for further analysis.
  - `style_analysis.html`: Styled HTML report.
  - `style_analysis.db`: SQLite database with indexed results.
