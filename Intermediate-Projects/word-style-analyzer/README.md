# Ultra-Advanced Word Document Style Analyzer

## Overview
This cutting-edge Python application redefines the analysis of Microsoft Word (.docx) documents by extracting and categorizing styled text (bold, italic, underlined, and combinations) with unparalleled sophistication. Leveraging multi-threaded processing, advanced NLP (tokenization, stopword removal, sentiment analysis with VADER), and a suite of output formats (append, JSON, CSV, HTML, SQLite), it delivers interactive visualizations, comprehensive metadata extraction, and scalable performance. Designed for researchers, data scientists, and professionals, this project embodies modern software engineering excellence and serves as a premier portfolio showcase.

## Features
- **Styled Text Extraction**: Identifies and categorizes bold, italic, underlined text, and all combinations across paragraphs and tables with high precision.
- **Multi-Threaded Processing**: Utilizes concurrent execution with configurable worker threads for optimized performance on large documents.
- **Advanced NLP**: Implements tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER, providing document-level sentiment insights.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Supports appending to the original document, JSON, CSV, styled HTML, and SQLite database export with indexing.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates high-quality, interactive Plotly plots with statistical overlays (bar and box plots) for styled word analysis.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Captures document metadata (author, creation date) for contextual richness.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes an extensive unit test suite covering analysis, sentiment, and export functionalities.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Employs structured logging to both file and console with verbose mode for detailed tracing.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for large-scale document processing with efficient memory usage and concurrent task management.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Libraries**: `python-docx`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`
- **NLTK Data**: Automatically downloaded on first run (requires internet connection).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-docx nltk matplotlib seaborn plotly pandas sqlalchemy

Dataset

Input: Any valid .docx file (e.g., process_design_notes.docx).
Output: Processed artifacts (JSON, CSV, HTML, SQLite) in the output/ directory, plots in plots/, and logs in the working directory.

How to Run

Setup Environment:

Install dependencies as listed above.
Ensure NLTK data is downloaded (handled automatically on first run).


Prepare Input:

Place your .docx file (e.g., process_design_notes.docx) in the working directory.


Execute the Script:
bash# For Linux/Mac
python3 style_analyzer.py process_design_notes.docx --output_format json --visualize
# For Windows
python style_analyzer.py process_design_notes.docx --output_format csv --verbose

Optional Flags:

--output_dir: Custom output directory (default: output).
--output_format: Choose append, json, csv, html, or db (default: append).
--max_workers: Number of concurrent workers (default: 8).
--visualize: Generate interactive plots (default: False).
--run_tests: Execute unit tests (default: False).
--verbose: Enable detailed logging (default: False).



Example Output

2025-08-12 17:00:02 - INFO - Exported results to JSON: output/process_design_notes.json
Analysis Summary: {'total_words': 250, 'styled_words_count': 15, 'sentiment_score': 0.75, 'author': 'John Doe', 'created': '2025-08-01T12:00:00', 'styled_words': {'b': ['Important', 'Note'], 'i': ['Emphasis'], ...}, 'execution_time': 2.50}
Execution time: 2.50 seconds

Visualization: Interactive bar chart with box plot saved as plots/styled_word_counts.html.

Artifacts

Logs: style_analyzer.log in the working directory.
Output Files: Generated in output/ (e.g., process_design_notes.json, process_design_notes.csv, process_design_notes.html, style_analyzer.db).
Plots: Saved in plots/ as interactive HTML files (e.g., styled_word_counts.html).

Improvements and Future Work

Advanced NLP: Integrate transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for enhanced sentiment and context analysis.
Real-Time Collaboration: Support for analyzing shared documents via cloud APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph).
Machine Learning Integration: Predict style usage trends with supervised learning models.
Accessibility: Enhance HTML outputs with ARIA labels for screen readers.
Performance Optimization: Implement caching and parallel processing with Dask for large document sets.
