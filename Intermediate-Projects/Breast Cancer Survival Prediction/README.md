# 🩺 Breast Cancer Survival Prediction: Forecasting Outcomes with Machine Learning

## 🌟 Project Vision
Dive into the realm of medical predictive analytics with the **Breast Cancer Survival Prediction** project, a sophisticated Python-based application that forecasts patient survival outcomes using machine learning. By analyzing key clinical features such as age, operation year, and positive axillary nodes, this system predicts whether a patient will survive ≥5 years post-surgery. With a robust Random Forest model, interactive Plotly visualizations, and a user-friendly CLI interface, this project is a compelling showcase of data science expertise, designed to elevate your portfolio to global standards.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Automated Data Acquisition** 📥: Downloads the Haberman’s Survival Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository if no local dataset is provided.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Visualizes patient demographics and survival patterns using interactive Plotly charts.
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🧠: Employs a Random Forest model to predict survival outcomes with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Predictions** 💉: Allows users to input patient details for real-time survival probability predictions.
- **Elegant CLI Interface** 🖥️: Offers intuitive commands for data analysis, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with comprehensive checks and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Scalable Design** ⚙️: Supports extensible models and datasets for diverse medical prediction applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power your analysis:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `plotly`
  - `ucimlrepo`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `wordcloud`

Install them with a single command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly ucimlrepo matplotlib wordcloud
```

### Dataset Spotlight
The **Haberman’s Survival Dataset** is the cornerstone of this prediction system:
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Haberman’s Survival Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/43/haberman+s+survival)).
- **Content**: Contains 306 records with columns for `age`, `operation_year`, `positive_axillary_nodes`, and `survival_status` (survived ≥5 years or died <5 years).
- **Setup**: Automatically downloaded via the `ucimlrepo` library, or you can provide a local CSV file with the same structure.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Analyze Survival Data
Perform EDA to explore patient characteristics and survival patterns:
```bash
python breast_cancer_survival.py --mode analyze
```

### 2. Train and Evaluate Model
Train the Random Forest model and evaluate its performance:
```bash
python breast_cancer_survival.py --mode train
```

### 3. Predict Survival
Generate survival predictions for a patient:
```bash
python breast_cancer_survival.py --mode predict --age 50 --operation_year 65 --nodes 3
```

### 4. Visualize Insights
Generate interactive visualizations for survival trends:
```bash
python breast_cancer_survival.py --mode visualize
```

### CLI Options
- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA), `train` (train and evaluate model), `predict` (survival prediction), or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to a local dataset (optional; defaults to downloading Haberman’s dataset).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).
- `--age`, `--operation_year`, `--nodes`: Patient details for prediction (required for `predict` mode).
