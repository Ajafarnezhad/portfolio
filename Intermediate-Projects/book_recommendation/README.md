# 📚 Book Recommendation System: Personalizing Reading with Python

## 🌟 Project Vision
Embark on a literary journey with the **Book Recommendation System**, a sophisticated Python-based application that delivers personalized book suggestions to enhance the reading experience. By leveraging content-based filtering and cosine similarity, this project analyzes book titles and authors to recommend similar books, drawing from a comprehensive dataset of book metadata. With stunning visualizations, a sleek command-line interface (CLI), and robust error handling, it’s a dazzling showcase of data science expertise, crafted to elevate your portfolio to global standards.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Seamless Data Processing** 📊: Loads and validates book metadata with robust checks for data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Visualizes book rating distributions and author productivity through interactive Plotly charts.
- **Content-Based Filtering** 🧠: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend books based on title and author similarity.
- **Personalized Recommendations** ✍️: Generates top-N book suggestions tailored to user-selected titles.
- **Elegant CLI Interface** 🖥️: Offers intuitive commands for data exploration, recommendation generation, and visualization.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with meticulous checks and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Scalable Design** ⚙️: Supports extensible recommendation algorithms and large datasets for diverse applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power your analysis:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `plotly`

Install them with a single command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```

### Dataset Spotlight
The **Books Dataset** is your gateway to personalized recommendations:
- **Source**: Available at [Kaggle Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).
- **Content**: Contains book metadata with columns for `bookID`, `title`, `authors`, and `average_rating`.
- **Size**: 11,127 books, ideal for content-based recommendation systems.
- **Setup**: Download and place `books_data.csv` in the project directory or specify its path via the CLI.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Analyze Book Data
Perform EDA to explore rating distributions and author productivity:
```bash
python book_recommendation.py --mode analyze --data_path books_data.csv
```

### 2. Generate Recommendations
Get personalized book recommendations for a specific title:
```bash
python book_recommendation.py --mode recommend --data_path books_data.csv --book_title "Dubliners: Text  Criticism  and Notes"
```

### 3. Visualize Insights
Generate interactive visualizations for book data:
```bash
python book_recommendation.py --mode visualize --data_path books_data.csv
```

### CLI Options
- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA), `recommend` (generate recommendations), or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset (default: `books_data.csv`).
- `--book_title`: Book title for recommendations (default: `Dubliners: Text Criticism and Notes`).
- `--top_n`: Number of recommendations to return (default: 10).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).
