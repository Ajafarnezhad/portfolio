# 📚 Article Recommendation System: Personalized Content with Machine Learning

## 🌟 Project Vision

Embark on a journey of intelligent content discovery with the **Article Recommendation System**, a sophisticated Python-based application that harnesses machine learning to deliver tailored article suggestions. By leveraging cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization, this system analyzes article content to recommend relevant reads, enhancing user engagement on platforms like blogs, news portals, or e-learning sites. With a sleek command-line interface (CLI), interactive Plotly visualizations, and robust error handling, this project is a standout addition to any data science portfolio, showcasing expertise in natural language processing and recommendation systems.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Content-Based Recommendations** 📖: Employs TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend articles based on textual content.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Visualizes article metadata and similarity patterns using interactive Plotly charts and word clouds.
- **Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline** 🧠: Utilizes scikit-learn for efficient text processing and similarity computation.
- **Interactive CLI Interface** 🖥️: Provides intuitive commands for data analysis, recommendation generation, and visualization.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging** 🛡️: Ensures reliability with comprehensive input validation and detailed logs for transparency.
- **Extensible Design** ⚙️: Supports integration of advanced algorithms and large-scale datasets for diverse applications.
- **Interactive Visualizations** 📊: Generates similarity heatmaps and word clouds for intuitive insights into article relationships.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: A curated suite of libraries to power the recommendation system:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `plotly`
  - `wordcloud`
  - `matplotlib`

Install them with a single command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly wordcloud matplotlib
```

### Dataset Spotlight

The **Article Dataset** is the cornerstone of this recommendation system:

- **Source**: Custom dataset inspired by real-world article metadata (e.g., AmanXai Articles Dataset).
- **Content**: Includes columns for `Title`, `Article` (text content), and optional metadata like `Category` or `Author`.
- **Size**: 1,000+ records, optimized for content-based recommendation tasks.
- **Setup**: Download and place `articles.csv` in the project directory or specify its path via the CLI.

## 🎉 How to Use

### 1. Analyze Article Data

Perform EDA to explore article content and similarity patterns:

```bash
python article_recommender.py --mode analyze --data_path articles.csv
```

### 2. Generate Recommendations

Generate article recommendations based on content similarity:

```bash
python article_recommender.py --mode recommend --data_path articles.csv
```

### 3. Visualize Insights

Generate interactive visualizations for article relationships:

```bash
python article_recommender.py --mode visualize --data_path articles.csv
```

### CLI Options

- `--mode`: Choose `analyze` (EDA), `recommend` (generate recommendations), or `visualize` (plot generation) (default: `analyze`).
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset (default: `articles.csv`).
- `--output_dir`: Directory for saving visualizations (default: `./plots`).

## 📊 Sample Output
