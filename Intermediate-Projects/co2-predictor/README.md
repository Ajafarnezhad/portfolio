## 🎮 How to Run

### 1. Explore the Data
Uncover insights with visualizations and summary statistics:
```bash
python co2_emissions_predictor.py --mode explore
```

### 2. Train the Model
Train and optimize ML models with customizable parameters:
```bash
python co2_emissions_predictor.py --mode train --test_size 0.2 --cv_folds 5
```

### 3. Predict CO2 Emissions
Predict emissions for new data (prepare a CSV with vehicle features):
```bash
python co2_emissions_predictor.py --mode predict --input_data new_data.csv
```

### 4. Customize Your Workflow
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset (e.g., `data/co2.csv`).
- `--model_path`: Save/load the trained model (e.g., `models/co2_model.joblib`).
- `--test_size`: Fraction of data for testing (e.g., `0.2` for 20%).
- `--cv_folds`: Number of cross-validation folds (e.g., `5`).
